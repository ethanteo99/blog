title: 20-Year Highlight Reel
---

I may have gotten to know some of you only in the last few years. And for others, I may have grown up with you but not kept in touch that well. To both old friends and new, I want to take this opportunity to piece those missing years together.

I turned 20 years old this past month, and thought it would be cool to reflect on some of the most important events of my life. So here’s a highlight/lowlight reel of every year of the last 20 years; hope you enjoy!
<br/><br/>


#### Age 0: Birth
<br/>
<img src="/assets/img/20-years/0.JPG" height="250" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display: block"/>
<br/>
February 1, 1999. My day of birth! I was a real fatty at 8 lbs, 13 oz. Fun fact: I was born in London, England. No, I don’t have a British citizenship. And no, I don’t have an accent. 
<br/><br/>

#### Age 1: Maryland
<br/>
<img src="/assets/img/20-years/1.JPG" height="250" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display: block"/>
<br/>
At the age of one, I moved from London to Ellicott City, Maryland. I don’t recall much about Ellicott City, but I do have fond memories of my time in Maryland (where I spent 7 years of my life). We moved from Ellicott City to Potomac (a suburb on the outskirts of Washington D.C.), where I formed my first close friendships. More on that later!
<br/><br/>

#### Age 2: ISFJ
<br/>

<br/>
Apparently I’ve always been a feelsy guy. Above is a precious photo of me channeling my inner ISFJ. I haven’t changed much.
<br/><br/>

#### Age 3: Beijing Wall's League
<br/>
<img src="/assets/img/20-years/3.JPG" height="250" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display: block"/>
<br/>
We moved to Beijing, China for about half a year because of my dad’s job. I remember this time being my first exposure to soccer; my parents enrolled me in a weekend soccer league called “Wall’s League”. I wasn’t very good at all — in fact, my parents tell me that I used to be so scared of soccer balls that I would run away and sometimes even cry if one rolled toward me. But here, I had the time of my life. 
<br/><br/>

#### Age 4: Education
<br/>
<img src="/assets/img/20-years/4.JPG" height="270" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display: block"/>
<br/>
The importance of childhood development is underrated. The photo above was taken on my 4th birthday during my pre-kindergarten class, when I learned that the earth orbits the sun every year. Honestly, that is so cool. I have to give my early teachers as well as my parents a lot of credit for always making an effort to cultivate an environment where I can be curious and can strive to learn and improve. 
<br/><br/>

#### Age 5: Audrey
<br/>
<img src="/assets/img/20-years/5-1.JPG" height="270" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display: block"/>
<br/>
When my parents told me that I was going to have a younger sibling, I recall rather having a baby brother than sister. Little did I know that my younger sister, Audrey, would turn out to be one of the greatest sources of joy in my life. She’s quite the opposite of myself: bubbly, creative, and witty, albeit also quite silly and forgetful. Audrey, thank you for being a blessing!

Side note: we’ve moved back to D.C. by this point in time.
<br/><br/>

#### Age 6: Legend of the Lost
<br/>
<img src="/assets/img/20-years/6-alt.JPG" height="250" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display: block"/>
<br/>
Storytime! One Saturday afternoon, my friend invited me and another boy from school over to his house for a playdate. Between some streets in his neighborhood were brooks where kids would go to play, and that’s what we decided to do that day. 

We made our way down the hill behind his house to a brook. I don’t quite remember what we were doing, but at some point we decided to try to jump across the brook. Not yet a star athlete at the time, I landed right in the middle of the brook, getting my socks and shoes wet. Luckily, we had soccer practice in a few hours, so I had an extra set of clothes back at my friend’s house. I made my way back up the hill (without my friends) to find his house and change into my soccer attire. I said I’d be back in just a few minutes.

I reached the top of the hill, but couldn’t find his house. Maybe it was another street or two down? I continued searching, getting increasingly anxious with every step I took. After about ten minutes, I decided to look for my friends and ask for their help. With my best effort, I retraced the steps I took back to the brook. I couldn’t find them. 

I started running up and down the hills, from brook to brook, screaming my friends’ names. Thorns from the bushes scattered on the hills began tearing my clothes, and tears were streaming down my face. I remember falling down several times upon tripping over these bushes, and tumbling down these hills, unable to get back on my feet. The adventure lasted what felt like over an hour, until I finally gathered enough courage to knock on the door of a stranger’s house to ask for help.

Fortunately, this was a really nice neighborhood. Seeing that I was alone and distraught, a middle-aged man answered the doorbell and immediately invited me into his home. He gave me food to eat and let me use his home phone to call my mom. My mom picked me up within thirty minutes. Meanwhile, the stranger showed me to his basement, where he had several arcade games (???) like Skee-Ball, Pinball, and Arcade Basketball. 

I recall joining my soccer team at practice that afternoon. I don’t remember if I even went home to brush up; I just remember being excited to see my friends again and play soccer with them. 

Note: I’m unsure how accurate my recollection of this story is, but I’ve told it to the best of my ability. 

Note 2: The image above isn’t of the actual brook, I took it off of this [link](https://goodshepherdwatertown.org/the-hidden-brook/).

#### Age 7: Guitar
<br/>
<img src="/assets/img/20-years/7.JPG" height="290" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display: block"/>
<br/>
My parents got me a classical guitar for my 7th birthday. At that time, I had already developed a love-hate relationship with the piano, so I was ecstatic to try something new. Although I quit classical guitar within a few years (which I regret deeply), guitar has continued to be an instrument that I adore with all my heart. I still play both acoustic and electric guitar frequently today, though I did miss out on a lot of useful technical training by quitting classical guitar.
<br/><br/>

#### Age 8: Beijing, Part 2
<br/>
<img src="/assets/img/20-years/8.JPG" height="300" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display: block"/>
<br/>
We moved back to Beijing for a second time, this time staying for four years. I attended the International School of Beijing (ISB) from 3rd to 6th grade and loved it! I had amazing teachers that challenged me in and out of the classroom, and made a lot of friends during my time there. I was so fortunate to have attended ISB, and honestly took my experience for granted, only realizing how special it was in recent years.
<br/><br/>

#### Age 9: Jedi Juggling
<br/>
<img src="/assets/img/20-years/9.JPG" height="300" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display: block"/>
<br/>
One of the coolest, wackiest things I learned to do as a kid was juggle. Our school’s head P.E. teacher, Mr. Callahan, oversaw an annual juggling show called the “Jedi Jugglers,” comprised of 4th and 5th grade students who spent their recess and lunch times practicing our juggling skills. We had an annual show where we would juggle all sorts of funky objects, ranging from toilet plungers to torches (yes, with real fire!). That same year, Mr. Callahan also taught me how to spin a basketball. What a time. 
<br/><br/>

#### Age 10: Saxophone
<br/>
<img src="/assets/img/20-years/10.JPG" height="300" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display: block"/>
<br/>
I picked up the alto saxophone in 5th grade. Learning the saxophone also led to my first exposure to jazz music, which I got hooked on. I was impressed by musicians who could improvise well, and made it a goal to be able to do that myself. Though I began my improvisation training on the saxophone, those skills transferred over nicely to piano and guitar! If you love music, improvising is one of the most useful skills you can develop because it gives you the tools to jam to any groove at any time. It is also just a beautifully freeing experience to be able to play whatever you desire without referring to sheet music. I don’t play saxophone anymore, but I’m thankful that I got into it! 
<br/><br/>

#### Age 11: "Capito"
<br/>
<img src="/assets/img/20-years/11.JPG" height="300" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display: block"/>
<br/>
When I first moved to Beijing in 2007, I was under the impression that I’d immediately be an athletic superstar. I first joined a soccer program under the Sports Beijing organization, and was so cocky that I tried out for the team intended for kids a year older than myself. I got my butt kicked at that tryout, and ended up joining the team of the correct age group (players born in 1999) as a benchwarmer. 

I was small, slow, and unskilled from the start. But year after year, I worked hard to improve as a soccer player. In my final year in Beijing, I was appointed to be the captain of our team! I still wasn’t a particularly talented player, but years of practice with the team helped me build my confidence as a leader and as well as my IQ on the field. It felt rewarding to overcome my underdog days. 

Also, my coach and teammates called me “capito”, which we all thought was Spanish for “captain”. Unfortunately, I only just recently learned that this is fake news. 
<br/><br/>

#### Age 12: Crippled
<br/>
<img src="/assets/img/20-years/12-alt.JPG" height="350" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display: block"/>
<br/>
When we moved to Shanghai the following year, the thing I was most looking forward to was joining a new soccer team. The day before school started and about a week prior to my first soccer tryout, I decided to practice on my own. I located an open turf field near my house and laced up my cleats, excited to begin drilling. 

A few minutes into practicing, I took a shot on goal. My left foot was planted firmly into the ground, but my body was off balance. My knee succumbed to the weight of my body leaning left, and the top of my left tibia snapped right. I collapsed to the ground, wincing in pain while muttering a string of curses under my breath. I lay there for a minute before eventually crawling over to the sideline, where I placed my phone and the rest of my belongings. 

I was given crutches and a knee brace to use for about three months. Of course, I was furiously disappointed at first, especially frustrated that I would have to wait until next year to play soccer again. In hindsight, the whole incident was a blessing in disguise.

Rather than attending soccer practices on Friday nights and Sunday mornings, I attended a Christian youth group and church services. Though I had grown up attending church, this was the first time that I experienced extravagant love from the church body. I was welcomed so warmly into my church community, and although I still had a lot to learn about Christianity, I felt very comfortable with and grateful for my church friends and leaders. 
<br/><br/>

#### Age 13: Microcampus
<br/>
<img src="/assets/img/20-years/13.JPG" height="300" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display: block"/>
<br/>
My school offered a unique opportunity to spend a month away from Shanghai and in a rural Chinese town called Xizhou in the province of Yunnan to learn about Chinese culture. They called this program Microcampus, and it was only in its second year running when I was in 8th grade. I was one of sixteen 8th graders chosen to participate. 

My particular focus area of study during my month there was to learn about music of the Bai people (the dominant ethnic group in Xizhou). My project consisted of writing an essay about the differences between Bai and western music, putting together a video on the same topic, and composing a short musical piece integrating elements of both styles. 

Although the academic experience was certainly fascinating, my biggest takeaway from this month-long escape from home was learning to be independent and responsible. I didn’t have the structure of school to give me direction every day, and had to learn to balance time spent on my project with time spent hanging out with friends. 

I am so privileged to have been given an opportunity like this to mature in independence and responsibility at such a young age without facing any serious dangers (we were chaperoned by a school teacher and his wife, and housing accommodations were quite nice).

#### Age 14: Palo Alto
<br/>
<img src="/assets/img/20-years/14.JPG" height="300" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display: block"/>
<br/>
After six years in China, we finally moved back to the US — this time, sunny California. I attended Palo Alto High School. There comes a pinch of awkward and a boatload of cringe as I reminisce about my high school days. I enjoyed the activities that I participated in, but have my fair share of regrets as well. I played basketball for a year and tennis for three, joined the debate team and the newspaper, and performed well in school. At the same time, I burned several bridges at the expense of personal success. I’d take it back if I could.
<br/><br/>

#### Age 15: Friends
<br/>
<img src="/assets/img/20-years/15.JPG" height="250" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display: block"/>
<br/>
I’ll be honest, I don’t remember too much from my first two years of high school. However, one defining aspect of my sophomore year was a newfound friend group. We weren’t exactly the cool kids on the block, but I’d say we had a pretty great time goofing off in Chinese class, eating our daily dose of Lulu’s burritos, and experimenting foolishly with the bench press at the YMCA. Unfortunately, I think our chests are all still fairly weak despite our efforts over the years. 
<br/><br/>

#### Age 16: Debate
<br/>
<img src="/assets/img/20-years/16.JPG" height="300" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display: block"/>
<br/>
I began competing on the debate team in my freshman year of high school. Though I certainly had zeal, I was largely unsuccessful until the end of my sophomore year, when I finally made it to elimination rounds of a tournament for the first time. I was never really a top debater, but I still did benefit greatly from the activity, learning to be more eloquent and persuasive in argumentation and speech. 

Through debate, I also learned that I really enjoy philosophical discussions. The style of debate (Lincoln-Douglas) that I competed in was values-oriented. This meant discussing political issues through a philosophical lens, and often investigating competing theories of morality and justice. I still have a deep interest in answering questions of purpose and ethics today, and I’m grateful that debate gave me a profound introduction to such topics.
<br/><br/>


#### Age 17: What's new(s)?
<br/>
<img src="/assets/img/20-years/17.JPG" height="350" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display: block"/>
<br/>
Perhaps my proudest high school achievement was becoming an Editor-in-Chief for my school newspaper, The Campanile. I treated that paper like it was my baby. Our staff of 60 students published 24 pages every three weeks, and the process of brainstorming, interviewing, writing, editing, and designing our paper was a constant grind. I loved it. 

Through my experience on the paper, I learned important lessons about leadership, teamwork, and discipline. My inner perfectionist turned me into an annoying micromanager; from this, I had to learn to trust others with good judgment. This was challenging for me, and in retrospect I see how good leadership is often simply humble servanthood, not the ego-stroking endeavour I originally imagined. 
<br/><br/>

#### Age 18: Berkeley
<br/>
<img src="/assets/img/20-years/18.JPG" height="350" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display: block;"/>
<br/>
I had mixed feelings about attending UC Berkeley. Fresh off a series of rejections from other top colleges, I felt that I had something to prove at Cal. I wasn’t exactly excited for the college experience, but I was eager to show the world that I had what it took to be professionally successful. I envisioned myself as a straight-A student, and hoped to get involved in multiple resume-boosting clubs while perhaps even interning somewhere on the side. 

My first semester in Berkeley was rough. I wasn’t getting the grades I had hoped for, got rejected from every club I applied to, and honestly felt lonely and homesick quite often. To top it off, it seemed that everybody else from high school was having the time of their lives in college already, so why wasn’t I? 

My advice to current freshmen: if you aren’t “totally living it up” in college, that is fine! Don’t feel pressured to do things you wouldn’t usually do just to shake things up; instead, focus on cultivating strong, meaningful friendships. The friends you make in college better be in it with you for the long haul — no academic achievement or party experience could possibly top a genuine and lasting friendship. 
<br/><br/>

#### Age 19: Christianity
<br/>
<img src="/assets/img/20-years/19.JPG" height="300" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display: block"/>
<br/>
Becoming a Christian has undoubtedly been the biggest event of my life to date. Despite growing up in a Christian household, I had a difficult time making Christianity personal. Seeing that I was pretty well off in life, I didn’t understand why I needed any help from a “savior”. I also saw Christianity as a lifestyle governed by arbitrary rules, rather than as a truth grounded in historical evidence and sound philosophical argumentation.

In my second semester at Berkeley, I took a “course” at my church on the foundations of Christianity and was surprised to find that I previously didn’t really understand fundamental concepts such as the nature of sin and God’s forgiveness. The course also gave a lot of convincing arguments for the existence of God and the resurrection of Jesus, which I really appreciated. 

However, the biggest turning point in my attitude toward Christianity was not in my philosophical understanding of the faith. We all strive for happiness, but what earthly success has ever promised true fulfillment? Time and time again, I have found the joy of my own accomplishments to be fleeting — it’s one achievement onto the next. I’m sure many of you feel the same. I am continuing to learn that it takes a lot of humility to admit that I don’t know what’s best for myself, but that there exists a loving God that does. The best part is that He offers this gift of eternal happiness to us for free, it’s only up to us to say yes.  
<br/><br/>

#### Age 20: To be continued...
I’m expecting my next decade of life to be a wild ride. In what way, you might ask? I have no idea. This I know: I’m letting God take the wheel, trusting that He knows better than I ever could. I’m excited for what’s to come, and I hope that you’ll all get to be a part of it in some way. If it’s been a while since we’ve talked, hit me up! I’ve shared plenty already, but I’d love to catch up and hear how you’ve been doing as well.

_"But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you." — Matthew 6:33_
