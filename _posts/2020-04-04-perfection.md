title: Perfection
---

I moved back home a couple of weeks ago due to the shelter-in-place restrictions and with my spare time I’ve been learning something new: music production. I didn’t think it would be too hard. Just lay down a couple of tracks, adjust their volumes, add some effects, and voila! Or so I thought. 

As I put together this short song, I learned that producing music is difficult. The sheer amount of thought that goes into creating good acoustics for recording and the myriad of filters and knobs used for a healthy mix can be overwhelming. 

That being said, I learned that the hardest part about recording music is overcoming my sense of perfectionism. In a recording, every blemish is exposed and immortalized, to be replayed over and over again. I found myself recording take after take, trying to get the perfect vocal track. And if I couldn’t achieve that, I’d spend another several hours trying to perfect my mix to eradicate my pitchiness. I was beginning to really get obsessive over the smallest details. It was frustrating and exhausting. 

I’m glad I was able to take a step back and think about why I was producing this song. I remembered that I’m making this art for the Lord! And the beautiful thing about God’s love for us is that He does not simply want our perfection or even our obedience. He wants our hearts. Thank God that though I have very little to offer Him, at the very least I can offer my heart. 

*"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment." Matthew 22:37-38*

The best part about being a Christian is not the fellowship of other believers. Even less so is it a sense of dignity or moral superiority. Truly, the best part is getting to walk with the Lord every day. To sit at His feet and just be in awe of the person of Jesus. 

*"One thing have I asked of the Lord,
    that will I seek after:
that I may dwell in the house of the Lord
    all the days of my life,
to gaze upon the beauty of the Lord
    and to inquire in his temple." Psalm 27:4*

##### House Of The Lord / Step By Step
	I love to live in Your house, O Lord
	I love to sit here at Your feet
	And let Your words be the food I eat
	The food I eat

	I love to live in Your house, O Lord
	Dine at the table with my King
	And give to You the praise I bring
	The praise I bring

	For here in Your house, I find Your embrace
	You set on my head a garland of grace
	When I lift my hands, You fill me with more
	Oh I love to live (I love to live)
	In the house of the Lord

	O God, You are my God
	And I will ever praise You

	I will seek You in the morning
	I will learn to walk in Your ways
	Step by step, You lead me
	And I will follow You all of my days
