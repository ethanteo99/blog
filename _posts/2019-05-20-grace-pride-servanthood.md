title: Grace, Pride, Servanthood
---

I got to briefly write about my Christian faith in the past two posts, and you may be wondering, what’s this all about? Turns out, my relationship with Christianity has been an enormous part of my life since coming to college. I was baptized last month on April 28, and it’s a day I’ll (hopefully) never forget! In light of this significant event, I thought it’d be fitting to share a little about why Christianity means so much to me.

#### Understanding Grace
*“Where shall I go from your Spirit? Or where shall I flee from your presence?” Psalm 139:7*

The word “grace” is a very churched term, and I’ve always wondered, who is grace and what’s so amazing about her? Kidding, but not really.

Today I see how the many ways in which God has pursued me throughout my life, despite my ignorance and stubbornness. I was fortunate to have grown up in a Christian household, always surrounded by loving Christian family and friends. Yet, I did not know how to relate to God on a personal level. My experience with church in middle school was positive and encouraging, clueing me into the beauty of Christian fellowship. However, heading into high school and in the midst academic and social pressure, I decided that further investigating Christianity wasn’t worth my time and energy. 

I recall my mom checking in with me every now and then throughout high school about where I was at with my Christian faith. I dreaded that question, knowing that I had been hiding from an honest relationship with God — I simply didn’t want to think about it. As a family, we attempted to do read the bible together on several different occasions, but I would say quite bluntly: “fine, but only if I have time”. Of course, I filled my schedule to the brim in order to excuse myself from this chore. In my junior year, our family began doing weekly bible studies together with several other family friends. It was an amazing opportunity for us all to grow together in our understanding of Christianity, but again, I was disengaged and arguably embarrassed that this was how I spent my Friday nights. 

Coming to college, I was passive in exploring Christianity; I was looking for a church, but more so just to check it off my to-do list and to reassure my parents that I was doing alright. At the start of freshman year, I attended a welcome event for the church I attend now. That night, I exchanged contact information with one of the church staff. And over the course of the next month, he invited me to a number of different church events — I attended a grand total of zero. I wanted to run away from the commitment of church, and eventually stopped responding to his texts altogether. Later that semester, a close friend who I first met at our freshman orientation invited to me to attend church with him. So I went with him, only to find that it was the exact same church that I had been avoiding. Awkward.

Nevertheless, after church service that day, I got connected with a few people from Acts2Fellowship (A2F), which is the Christian fellowship that I am still a part of today. I began attending A2F sporadically — school was my clear priority. I felt like I gained little from the few messages I sat in on, and did not grow particularly close in friendship with anybody at A2F. By the end of my first semester, I seriously considered leaving church altogether; I saw it as a barrier to my academic success and vision for the future. 

But God tugged at my heartstrings over that Winter Break. There was something about this fellowship that I knew was special. People at A2F poured out their love for random college students unlike anybody I had ever met — they took precious time out of their own lives to cook meals and prepare bible studies for barely-interested students like myself. They encouraged me through difficult weeks of school in various ways. I felt a genuineness in their desire to get to know who I was; my background, my interests, and my faith. The pastor’s messages were always very challenging, and I found myself disagreeing with a lot of what was said, but the A2F regulars did not leave me hanging. They wanted me to confront these challenges honestly, and were willing to walk me through my questions. They did not merely want me to be a Christian: at the heart of it, I saw that they simply wanted me to be a seeker of truth. 

I decided to give Christianity one last shot — one final semester. I told myself that if I didn’t see spiritual growth in the upcoming spring semester, I would continue on my merry way to becoming a success in this world, avoiding God all the while. 

I’m sure you can guess how that turned out. God is so good. Through my parents, my church upbringing, my experience with A2F, and in a hundred more ways, He chased me down day after day, year after year, to reveal to me His love for me. In all of my running and rejection, God was still ready to welcome me back home. Now I understand amazing grace — God’s patience is infinite, and His love is unconditional. 

#### Acknowledging Pride
*“For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.” Romans 3:23-24*

Receiving God’s love was a great first step for me, but now I was confronted with an equally important issue: did I really feel that I needed God in my life? Sure, He wants a relationship with me, but what do I gain from it, if anything? After all, my life did feel on track. So why did I need God?

As humans, we all have this uncanny ability to pick and choose what to remember about ourselves and others. Scientifically, this is explained by a psychological phenomenon called the Fundamental Attribution Error: we attribute our own flaws to external circumstances, but attribute others’ flaws to internal characteristics. For example, we instinctively think poorly of drivers who cut us off in traffic, but excuse the very same behavior for ourselves when we are late to an appointment. Trivial illustration, but you get the point. 

As I reflected very honestly on my own self — my thoughts, desires, motivations, and behaviors — I saw that I was prideful to a fault. It prevented me from properly receiving due criticism and caused me to be selfish in my relationships. Wanting to be well-liked and respected, I found myself willing to throw others under the bus if it meant achieving exactly that. 

My pride wasn’t just a barrier to friendship, it was a barrier to living Christian life. Having thought that I could create my own heaven on earth through my own doing, I had no reason to include God in my life’s picture. However, slowly but surely, I came to see that all my striving and achievement could not fulfill my desire to be known and loved. 

I saw how drastically different my life was from what God had intended for me. Even if I felt that I was living an above-average life compared to others, Jesus set the perfect, holy standard, and I was far off. I found myself trying my best to rationalize my every behavior, ultimately telling myself and others the lie that I was living a life of integrity and love. 

Here’s the good news of the Gospel: I no longer have to strive to meet this holy standard. By his death and resurrection, Jesus has taken the punishment that I deserve for my sins and has made me blameless before God. Maybe this sounds like an awful lot of mumbo-jumbo to you, but here’s the tl;dr — we are all forgiven and loved by God. And that makes our job infinitely easier; all we have to do acknowledge His forgiveness, and He will make us perfect in our weaknesses. 

#### Embracing Servanthood
*“For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.” Galatians 5:13*

If I’m honest, it isn’t easy to love. Love requires time and effort. It means being patient, truthful, and humble. It mandates servanthood. Greed is far more convenient. 

There’s a story in Matthew 26 about a woman who came to Jesus with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume and poured it on His head out of love. Obviously, perfume is usually not to be poured but sprayed in small amounts. As she did this, Jesus’s disciples exclaimed, “why this waste?”

This year, I’ve been challenged by the act of servanthood. I had the privilege of serving on a mission trip in Chicago over winter break, leading weekly prayer meetings for our fellowship, and opening up our apartment to friends to hang out, eat, and study together. I’d find myself choosing to forgo a night of studying to help out a friend in need, or cooking meals for others despite facing a busy week of school myself. And then I’d ask myself, “why this waste?” Like anybody naturally would, I’d wonder whether I’m making the most of the precious time that is ticking away. 

But as I recall my own story of salvation, it all makes sense to me again. Of course it’s worth it. When I think back on my journey with Christ, I remember all of the little things that others did for me in hope that I would one day find God and experience His love — and I did. Every little thing that was done for me was worth it. Seeing how I have been renewed in my own faith, I realize that servanthood is never a waste; every ounce of love that I have to offer is worth sharing. And so I will try my very best.
