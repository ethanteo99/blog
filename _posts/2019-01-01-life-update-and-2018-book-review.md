title: Life Update + 2018 Book Review!
---
Hi everyone! Happy New Year, and welcome to my first blog post! This past year was filled with amazing memories and an abundance of blessings, but I did a very poor job at documenting the major events in my life, both good and bad, and sharing them with others. Much of it was due to a necessary break from social media and an urge to feel comfortable in my own skin again — to pursue my hobbies and learn about myself in a carefree manner. But it’s time that I crawl back out of my hole into the world and interact with you all again somehow, especially friends and family who I don’t see often anymore and/or haven’t kept in touch with very well (I miss you!).

#### The Importance of Reading

I’m going to start this year off with a simple topic. One habit that I’m really glad I finally got into this year is **reading**. If you’re anything like I was in high school, you didn’t read any books besides what was assigned, if even that (hello Sparknotes!). And gradually, the less I read, the less I enjoyed reading. It became difficult for me to read even just a few pages without getting distracted. 

It was at the start of 2017 that I wanted to begin reading again. Not because I was particularly interested in doing so, but because many of my elders told me that it was a good habit to have. I jumped into it somewhat ambivalently, hoping that somehow I’d come out more knowledgeable. 

I read a little bit in 2017, but still wasn’t yet on a roll. As with anything, it takes time to acclimate to a new normal. I fared much better in 2018, reading a total of 13 books, not including about 4-5 books that I stopped reading halfway through due to lack of interest. 

What’s important isn’t how much I read, but what I learned from this journey. Like I said before, I blindly jumped into this habit hoping that it’d benefit me in some way. And now I can testify that it has; I’ve concluded two important ways in which reading is valuable, although I’m sure there are many more.

1. Reading feeds you knowledge that others, presumably experts, have already spent time researching deeply and organizing into manageable and sensible chunks of information. While it’s true in some sense that you can learn similar information just by observing the world, reading an expert’s opinion or perspective on an issue makes synthesis of material far easier. 

2. Reading gives you time and space to think as you’re learning about a given issue, because you control the pace of information flow. On the contrary, videos, podcasts, and even life experiences tend to be much faster, making it tempting to scarf down information without pausing to consider implications and alternatives. Reading allows you to improve your critical thinking, giving you plenty of opportunities to challenge whatever text you’re reading.

With that in mind, I also wanted to share the three most personally impactful books that I read in 2018. I enjoyed them greatly, and would highly encourage you to check them out on your own time!

#### Letters from a Skeptic — Gregory and Edward Boyd

_“Love must be chosen. It must be free, and it must be from the heart, without external motivations.”_

2018 was the year I became a Christian. Although I grew up in a Christian household, I didn’t make my faith personal until I came to college. One of the biggest reasons for this was because I had not bothered to investigate arguments and evidence for Christianity as an objectively true philosophy prior to college. There are many people that I have to thank for being amazing mentors and peers who have helped me along the way, but this book was also integral in clarifying difficult questions and misconceptions that I had about Christianity. 

*Letters From A Skeptic* is a written dialogue between Pastor Greg Boyd and his adamantly atheist father, Ed Boyd. Ed is highly skeptical of Christianity and asks Greg a slew of difficult questions regarding topics including the nature of free will, the problem of evil, and credibility of the Bible. After two years and 29 correspondences between Greg and Ed, Ed is finally reasonably convinced of Christianity and makes a decision to commit his life to Jesus Christ.

One issue that I had always been frustrated about was the conflict between a loving God and the existence of evil in the universe. After all, if God was really all-powerful and loving, why would He allow acts of evil to occur and harm the very creatures He wants to love?

From this book, I was reaffirmed of the idea that God is a relationship-seeking entity. He is all-powerful in the sense that He technically has the power to will anything in the universe into existence or action, but He chooses to grant us free will such that we can choose to freely love Him in return, in the same way that He loves us. True love isn’t possible without free will, and God desires a loving relationship with us so much that he is willing to risk the possibility of our rejection of Him and His creation. 

Of course, the line of argumentation is far more elaborate than I’ve summarized above. If you’re curious about Christianity or have trouble reconciling Christian moral principles with what you know and believe about life already, I highly recommend *Letters From A Skeptic*. It clarified a lot of confusion that I had, and played a crucial role in convincing me that Christianity is a true doctrine. 

#### Homo Deus — Yuval Noah Harari

_“The most common reaction of the human mind to achievement is not satisfaction, but craving for more.”_

I previously mentioned that I became a Christian this past year. Specifically, I made my salvation decision in March. I decided to read *Homo Deus* — which was lying around in my bedroom in Palo Alto — over the summer. The reason why I’m including *Homo Deus* in my list of most impactful books is because it made me seriously question and doubt my Christian faith. It forced me to think critically about my religious beliefs, and not blindly follow what I was told at church. 

*Homo Deus*, written by the same author of bestseller Sapiens, explores the past, present, and possible future of Homo Sapiens. I did (and still do) agree with many of the hypotheses that Harari makes in the book for the nature and future of humanity, including the rise of an algorithmic, data-driven world as well as the desire for humans to biologically upgrade their lives. However, one claim that Harari states repeatedly is the death of God and religion in the midst of the rise of science. Having just recently committed my entire life to following God, this obviously sent me into somewhat of a panic mode. 

Harari makes the argument that as technology becomes increasingly powerful, there becomes less of a need for human comfort in common religious beliefs such as the existence of God, heaven, and afterlife. I was quite convinced of his argument at the time of reading it: if humans can find ways to chemically and scientifically enhance our lives to the point where we are always in a state of pleasure and have eliminated all threats of pain, isn’t that just as good as heaven itself? We don’t need heaven if we can create our own heaven here on Earth, Harari says. 

As I continued to question the notion of perfection, I became increasingly confident in my spiritual beliefs. I do agree that humanity is headed in the direction of biological upgrades and on-demand chemical enhancers. After all, technology has always been this way — seeking to make humans physically, mentally, and emotionally stronger. But I cannot agree that it is possible for humans to create heaven on Earth. 

To me, heaven is where a human soul is eternally and wholly fulfilled. And I don’t believe that true fulfillment can be artificially satisfied through tricks in human biology and chemistry. Humans have deeper longings than mere physical pleasures, longings that cannot ever be solved with any sort of advanced technology. Such solutions are merely fleeting. 

Even as we increase our scientific knowledge, we still have to deal with the flawed human condition that is inherently full of arrogance, greed, and selfishness. Harari said it himself: “The most common reaction of the human mind to achievement is not satisfaction, but craving for more.” We will never be satisfied with our own achievements and creations. We will continue to crave.

I still think we have a lot to be excited about with science; it has immense potential for practical altruism. I am a STEM major, after all. But I do not believe that science is the solution to the problems inherent in human nature, nor do I believe that it can explain why these problems exist. There has to be another dimension to human fulfillment, and I have personally found that in my Christian faith. 

So when Harari claims that “God is dead,” I now suspect he means it in a similar way that Nietzsche meant it. Not necessarily that God has been scientifically disproven, but that people of this current generation now deem God less and less necessary in their own lives. Perhaps a scary thought, especially if we are lying to ourselves that we will be able to solve humanity's problems on our very own. 

#### Chaos Monkeys — Antonio Garcia Martinez
_“Capitalism is an amoral farce in which every player — investor, employee, entrepreneur, consumer — is complicit.”_

Slight change of pace and topic with this one. While I’ve been extraordinarily caught up in philosophizing about life in college, figuring out a career direction remains an incessant frustration. Being a Computer and Cognitive Science major, entering the tech industry seems to be the most natural career trajectory, so I figured I’d read something about it.

*Chaos Monkeys* is Antonio Garcia Martinez’s narrative about his experience as a startup founder and his abrupt transition into a product management role at Facebook after selling his startup to Twitter, through which he illustrates how participants in Silicon Valley’s tech culture are like the chaos monkeys of society. In sum, Silicon Valley is supposedly crazy; full of deceitful negotiations and internal politics. 

Just a few years ago, it was a dream of mine to be an entrepreneur (not that I actually had an idea, or anything). And I’m sure this is true of the majority of my Bay Area peers as well. But successful entrepreneurship requires a lot from a person — burning passion, physically and emotionally draining work hours, and harsh decision-making, among others. So why is it that so many teens are obsessed with become famous and successful in tech?

The Silicon Valley tech life is certainly **over-glorified**; it’s the new Wall Street. It’s beaten into our dead horse minds that software engineering and product management are objectively the best career routes to take. And that is some seriously dangerous thinking. 

Whether Martinez is correct or not about Silicon Valley life, I cannot yet confirm. It seems likely that a lot of the corporate drama that Martinez details in his book tends to occur in higher levels of management. And of course, the purpose of writing the book was to expose dramatic moments in his career, so there’s probably some exaggeration in his depiction of events. But his message is still clear: watch out. 

Obviously, I’m disappointed that this is how Martinez illustrates Silicon Valley. But if and when the day comes that I become a chaos monkey of society, I expect myself to remain grounded in my integrity. I expect to shake things up not to a chaotic point of destruction, but by reversing the direction of influence such that I can set a good example for those around me. *Chaos Monkeys* reminds me to be ready, to be wary, and to avoid being naive when I enter the battlefield. And the more I understand the nature of the tech industry, even if it is negative, the better prepared I’ll be to make a meaningful difference. After all, you have to know the enemy to beat the enemy. 

#### Conclusion

If you made it this far, I applaud you. In all honesty, this post turned out about three times longer than I intended for it to be. But as usual, I had a lot on my mind and just couldn’t stop writing. I’m hoping that my future posts won’t be quite as long as this one. :) 

Anyway, thanks for reading! I truly hope you enjoyed it, and are perhaps curious about the books I read or the insights I had to share. Don’t be a stranger; wherever you are, let me know if you want to chat and catch up! Have a blessed 2019, and stay tuned for more from me.
