Hi! My name is Ethan. I'm a sophomore at UC Berkeley studying Computer and Cognitive Science. Growing up, I'm fortunate to have moved around a lot, having lived in London, Washington D.C., Beijing, Shanghai, Palo Alto, and now Berkeley. I enjoy good music and competitive activities. The following are critical to my life philosophy: free speech, humility, and sincerity. 

For now, this site will be a space where I can share life updates and important (or trivial) thoughts through a blog format. In the future, I may add other kinds of content - you'll have to stick around to see that!
